This study investigates the relationship between theory and implementation amalgamations within Natural Language Processing models, researching how the use of older techniques can be brought to life with modern fundamentals for feature extraction of textual classification methods on Student Feedback; this project researched several NLP methods such as Bag-Of-Words, POS-tagging and Word2Vec categorised as Classical, Modern, and Contemporary approaches. To demonstrate the project hypothesis, two indented models were created to display performance differences based on open-source datasets.

This project concluded \ldots This project faced one major limitation, being dataset sample size of student feedback, however, this did not affect the results of the model itself.
