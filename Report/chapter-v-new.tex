\chapter{Project Design - New}

TThis chapter outlines the design behind each component of the text classification model and the respected process each component may entail, several components will execute more than one step to achieve the desired result. The design is reflected within the final model and each component is broken down to display the functionality and theory within this project. \ref{section:FunctionalRequirements}, it is detailed there wonâ€™t be a GUI for the interaction and thus the design section relates to the inner workings of the model itself, that being: system architecture, logistics and theory.

\section{Classical vs Modern}

As originally intended, this project would have seen two differing implementations of the same concept, one being of a classical nature implemented as a machine learning model and the other being a modern variation of the same approach, as previously mentioned this project experienced time management issues due to unexpected problems, to which resulted in only focusing on a traditional implementation within a modern model in attempt at a novel approach.

This section will read in reverse order because of the implementation phase; the modern implementation would have
