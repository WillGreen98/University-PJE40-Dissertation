\chapter{Conclusion}

From the research conducted, it is evident that the Word2Vec implementation does hold promise for future development with different implementations, it is also evident that the Word2Vec model is a viable approach at tackling text classification on student feedback datasets, even if the dialect is not the same or holds different grammatical structures to that of a native speaker.

This project conducted research regarding how implementations can be altered by using technological approach's from different eras; modern implementations and machine learning models are often praised for yielding the highest accuracy, however, older implementations still have vital theoretical aspects that can be taken advantage of when coinciding with a modern approach. The findings in this paper are not complete but still hold value as to how modern technology can sway it's perspective on last generation computational power.

The amount of resources and man-hours to develop a systematical approach at handling every combination of theory and practice is unthinkable, but with technology, often the journey teaches more than the end result, which the develope likes to think was a large aspect of this paper.
